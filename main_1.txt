Adding a file. That's main_1.txt.


Adding a second line on line number 4. 

Adding another line from anoop branch from local machine. Need to see how this one goes. 


Making some significant changes. No need to worry. Just keep calm and go on!


Okay, now adding further changes. From the local machine. I think I'm getting it now. Finally! Git is being beaten!


I'm adding further changes. I'm loving it. This is fun when you consider it that way.
